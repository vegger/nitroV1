# Shared

This is a place for shared assets and base codefragmets you want to use
from different patterns or applications.

Recommended directory structure:

##`assets/`

This place is for assets you need in production

-   images you want to minify with a gulp task (e.g. favicons, ...)
-   ...

##`base/`

Use for "base patterns" like:

-   base styling for html and body
-   CSS normalize or reset
-   webfonts definition
-   ...

##`utils/`

Mainly for mixins and variable definitions. Every concept

-   responsive concept with breakpoints
-   color system
-   grid definition and helpers
-   typography mixins
-   ...
